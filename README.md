# Data Structures in Java and C

This repository contains solutions to various data structure problems ranging from beginner to advanced levels, implemented in **Java** and **C**. The focus is on learning and applying fundamental concepts of data structures through practical coding examples.

## 🚀 Features

- Beginner to advanced problems on data structures.
- Solutions implemented in both **Java** and **C**.
- Clean and well-documented code for easy understanding.

## 📂 Structure

All the code files are stored in the root directory. Each file is named based on the problem or topic it addresses. Examples:

- `ArrayOperations.java` / `ArrayOperations.c` - Basic array operations.
- `LinkedList.java` / `LinkedList.c` - Implementation of singly linked lists.
- `Stack.java` / `Stack.c` - Stack implementation using arrays or linked lists.
- `Queue.java` / `Queue.c` - Queue implementation.
- `BinaryTree.java` / `BinaryTree.c` - Binary tree traversal and operations.
- `GraphTraversal.java` / `GraphTraversal.c` - Graph traversal algorithms like BFS and DFS.

## 📖 Topics Covered

- Arrays
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, BSTs, Heaps)
- Graphs (BFS, DFS, MST)
- Hashing
- Sorting and Searching Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming Basics

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Languages**: Java, C
- **Tools**: Any standard IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, Code::Blocks, etc.)
